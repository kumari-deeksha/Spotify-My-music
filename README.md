# Spotify-My-music
I have used HTML, CSS and JavaScript in this project.
In this project I have created a website called Spotify-My music. It includes some songs to play and these songs are No copyright songs.
In this one can play any song from the song list and can pause it any time.
The playing song can be changed with next song or previous played song.
Any song can be changed from the playlist.
